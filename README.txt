This 8-bit Microprocessor was made as part of our BTech Major Project in Shiv Nadar Institute of Eminence, under the guidance and supervision of Dr. Venkatnarayan Hariharan. All the required documents have been uploaded in the documents folder and any further documentation will be uploaded in the same folder. 

We decided to take on this project after being introduced to the workings of other processors throughout our graduation. We have taken inspiration from the 8085 microprocessor as well as RNBIP, which is available on GitHub. Our processor is an 8-bit microprocessor, having 8 registers, an accumulator and an Instruction Set of 36 instructions. The 8 registers can also be used in pairs to perform certain instructions. The top-module encases the mid-module and memory (64KB) and the mid-module holds all the other modules necessary. Any instruction takes a maximum of 6 cycles.
